        <h2>
          Threats to photo anonymity
        </h2>
        <p>
          More and more today it seems like no piece of data can be safely
          anonymized. Anonymous data is disconnected from personal identifiers,
          such as names and birth dates.[2] To be anonymized would mean that the
          data could not be reconnected to the person who the data was
          originally from.[2] A
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3">
            2019 study from Imperial College London
          </a>
          found that 99.9% of Americans could be individually identified with
          just 15 characteristics from widely available data.[3] Similarly,
          <a
            href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6221/536.full.pdf?casa_token=Oypa6Ooyo7gAAAAA:kUMWp8xgJ5t-EL7ETaHlqnCSumyCxVacHeWXbVVV7G4b06qCC8-55fmkDdL4P4pUdjGoFj_X4cjb"
          >
            2015 MIT study
          </a>
          found that 90% of people in an ‘anonymized’ data set of store credit
          card transactions could be identified.[4] Anonymization techniques
          that researchers, businesses and others have been using for decades
          now are being revealed to be inadequate,[2] threatening anonymity in
          all corners of our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          Photos are not exempt from new threats to anonymity. Almost all photos
          now come with extensive metadata automatically added when the photo is
          taken.[5] Metadata is “data about data”; meaning the metadata
          describes the data point in question.[6] This metadata can include
          fields like: the photographer’s name, the GPS coordinates of where the
          photo was taken, and the date and time when the photo was taken.[5]
          And applications like Google Photos, or Apple’s iPhoto can
          automatically add metadata tagging the faces of people in photos.[5]
          This metadata can be identified and read by anyone able to access the
          photo online.[7] While many users may have learned to check the visual
          context of a photo for content they would find privacy invading to
          share publicly, many do not realize the amount of information shared
          in the metadata of photos they share.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, this privacy threat can easily be combatted if users are
          aware of it. The anti-surveillance non-profit the
          <a href="https://www.eff.org/">
            Electronic Frontier Foundation
          </a>
          writes
          <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en">
            “Surveillance Self-Defense” guides
          </a>
          for different people who are especially vulnerable to surveillance.[8]
          In their guide for activists attending protests, they advise activists
          to remove the metadata from any photos they took and are hoping to
          upload in order to protect their personal information.[9] They suggest
          the simple method of taking a screenshot of an image, and posting the
          screenshot to avoid metadata concerns.[9] This method allows people
          who rely on anonymity online like activists to avoid identification
          when posting important photos.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Facebook’s patent, “Associating cameras with users and objects in
          a social networking system”,[1] presents a new threat to anonymous
          photos. The patent uses “camera signatures”, unique characteristics of
          cameras like “faulty pixel positions in the camera and metadata
          available in files storing the images” to identify other photos taken
          by the same camera and link them to that user.[1] It also allows
          Facebook to make connections between different users based off of who
          is sharing a single camera.[10] In the patent abstract, Facebook’s
          suggested uses are: “recommending potential connections to a user,
          recommending events and groups to users, identifying multiple user
          accounts created by the same user, detecting fraudulent accounts, and
          determining affinity between users.”[1] The listed uses suggest that
          Facebook could de-anonymize the accounts but also the links between
          people posting what were previously anonymous photos.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before Facebook filed this patent, most people did not realize how
          much personal information photo metadata reveals about them. However,
          those who did realize could easily combat this problem, like the EFF
          suggests by taking a screenshot of the photo before posting. But
          Facebook’s patent threatens to make those efforts obsolete. If photos
          can be used to match a photo taken on a personal account with a photo
          uploaded ‘anonymously’ to a protest page, or if photos used by several
          different organizations could be linked together to identify one
          person, then this could put activists and protestors in great danger.
          But this patent exposes threats beyond just for those who rely on
          anonymity to stay alive and out of jail.
        </p>

        <p>
          This patent reveals the issue that those efforts suggested by the EFF
          were never really enough; metadata has always made our personal
          information accessible when photos are posted by those who do not know
          or remember to remove it. We need to problematize the issue of privacy
          in posting online photos. Additionally, as Raley argues in “Raw Data”
          Is an Oxymoron, we must understand data collection and the inferences
          that companies make about us as a result of that data as part of a
          capitalistic control system.[11] In this modern panoptic capitalistic
          system, “willingly” give up our data to become seen only as our data
          by this control system.[11] But the consequences of this control and
          surveillance are not just a loss of privacy but a system where
          companies are made powerful by data collection control and manipulate
          our actions through “dataveillance”.[11] And this system can reinforce
          or make worse existing inequalities, using digital data to sort and
          categorize people in real life.[12]

        <h2>
          Solutions
        </h2>
        <p>
          I built this website to help with this problem, but it is by no means
          a perfect solution, just a start. The best solution would likely be if
          social media companies automatically scrubbed metadata from our photos
          as we posted them, but their incentives to sell more targeted
          advertising push them to collect more information about us, not
          less.[11] The next best solution would be an app which scrubbed all
          metadata and camera signatures from any photo automatically on one’s
          computer or phone. This would be best because it would keep the user
          from having to think about it, before posting a photo, making avoiding
          surveillance easier and making them more likely to use it. However,
          because of technical limitations, that is not the project I have
          created.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, I built a website that I hope achieves two things.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I wanted to give people tools to try to resist some of the
            surveillance they live under and protect their privacy. Thus there
            are two tools on this website: one removes metadata from photos, and
            the other adds some noise to photos in the form of steganogaphic
            messages in the hopes that will change the camera signature of the
            photo. The hope is that people can post photos which do not reveal
            more about them than the contents of the photos itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            I hope that this can educate people about the information they are
            sharing unwittingly through sharing photos online, and raise
            awareness about surveillance in our daily lives.

          Methods
        </h2>
        <h4>
          Hiding camera signatures with steganography
        </h4>

        <p>
          One common resistance method to digital surveillance is to insert
          noisy or random data to mask real data collected about digital
          actions. By using this method, you can attempt to not only hide the
          real data being collected, but also make reliance on the data not
          commercially valuable. This method is employed in projects like
          TrackMeNot, a web browser extension that hides your real search and
          browsing data from third party trackers by periodically sending noisy
          packets of data to the tracking companies.[11]
        </p>

        <p>
          There is also a long history of using a method called "steganography"
          to conceal information. Steganography is “the practice of hiding
          secret messages in otherwise non-secret mediums.”[13] Least
          significant bit steganography involves the practice of hiding images
          or messages in other images by replacing the last few digits (the
          least significant bits) of a binary representation of a pixel with a
          message.[14] This shows that you can randomly change the pixel values
          of a photo and not significantly change the image.
        </p>

        <p>
          Digital image steganography uses the last few, least valuable bits
          used to encode a pixel to hide data. Changing these bits changes the
          color value of the pixel only very slightly. Thus, you can change the
          pixels and use the value of those pixels to encode secret messages
          that can only be decoded by a program reading the values of the last
          few pixels separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below is an image demonstrating how the Least Significant Bit
          Steganography works. In the example the bits changed only make up the
          numbers zero through three, so modifying those bits only changes the
          pixel value (which can range from 0 to 256 for each color that makes
          up the pixel) by 0 to 3 numbers.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Metadata Removal
        </h4>

        <p>
          The EFF guide to Surveillance Self Defense explains that removing
          metadata from an image is possible, and fairly simple.[9] However,
          many people are unaware of this, and commonly upload photos to the
          internet with information they did not realize they were including.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most photo metadata is stored in formats like EXIF, IPTC or XMP.[5]
          The tool I am using only removes the EXIF metadata tags, which are
          those added by most phones and digital cameras.[5]

          Limitations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Obviously, there are some major limitations to this website. As said
          before this is not the most convienent method. Additionally, because I
          have not tested whether a camera signature remains once steganographic
          messages are hidden, I cannot guarantee that it erases the camera
          signature. Additionally, because of the limitations of my technical
          knowledge, I cannot guarentee that the tools made by other developers
          on github work perfectly, only so far as I can verify them by checking 
          the metadata that tool it registers and the hidden message that the other
          tool registers.
