        <h3>
          This website is an attempt to raise awareness about threats to privacy
          and anonymity online and try to help protect people from some of these
          threats.
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Did you know that your photos have metadata attached to them that have
          information like?:
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>the photographer's name</li>
          <li>GPS coordinates where the photo was taken</li>
          <li>date and time where the photo was taken</li>
          <li>type of camera that took the photo</li>
          <li>
            facial recognition tags placed by Apple Photos and Google Photos
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
          Did you know that even without that metadata, just by looking at a
          photo you took, Facebook can identify that you took it?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Facebook filed a patent in 2010 to allow them to associate users
          photos using just the flaws and imperfections in the camera lens and
          pixels as a "camera signature".
        </p>

        <h4>
          On this website you can:
        </h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Go to the about page to learn more about photo anonymity and how
            both privacy protecting tools work
          </li>

          <li>
            Go to the photo cleaner page to upload a photo and download the
            image with some noise inserted, in an attempt to protect you from
            being identified just by the patterns in the photo's pixels
          </li>

          <li>
            Go to the metadata removal page to upload a photo and download the
            image with the metadata removed, in an attempt to protect the
            personally identifiable information in the metadata.
          </li>
        </ul>
